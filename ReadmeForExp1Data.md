# Datasets used for Liew, Howe, & Little 2016, Experiment 1.

This data contains the individual choices made during the preferential choice session of Experiment 1.

Explanation of each column follows. 
Columns 1-3 are self-explanatory.

4. ID - Unique participant ID

5. Condition -
    Negative values indicate catch trials, with options on varying levels of average values.
   
    **Similarity Effect**
    * (1) All options high on y-axis, decoy higher on y-axis. 
    * (2) All options high on y-axis, decoy higher on x-axis.
    * (3) All options high on x-axis, decoy higher on y-axis.
    * (4) All options high on y-axis, decoy higher on x-axis.
      
    **Attraction Effect**
    * (1) Range decoy higher on y-axis. 
    * (2) Range decoy higher on x-axis. 
    * (3) Frequency decoy higher on y-axis. 
    * (4) Frequency decoy higher on x-axis. 
    * (5) Range-Frequency decoy higher on y-axis. 
    * (6) Range-Frequency decoy higher on x-axis.
      
    **Compromise Effect**
    * (1) All options high on y-axis.
    * (2) All options moderate on x- and y-axes.
    * (3) All options high on x-axis.


7. TrialNum - Trial number

7-12. x- and y-values of each of the three choices. The A, B, and C labels correspond to the order in which they were displayed.

15. Response - The response made by the participant (i.e., 1 is Choice A, 2 is Choice B, 3 is Choice C).

16. Order - The mapping of focal(1), nonfocal(2), and decoy(3) to the displayed choices. For example, 312 indicates that Choice A was the decoy, Choice B was the focal, and Choice C was the nonfocal.

17. Selection - Indicates whether it was ultimately the focal(1), nonfocal(2), and decoy(3) that was chosen.
